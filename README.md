# Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Amber Alert

A NLP-based sentiment analysis on people's opinion on Amber Alert (Canada) with TweepyAPI.

## Description

(Abstract from written report) An Amber Alert is a message which informs the public that a child has been abducted1
. In Canada, when an Amber Alert is received on a mobile device, a loud sound will be played,
the device will vibrate, and a message will appear on the screen. The message includes
information of the abducted child and the last seen location.

Some mobile devices do not have the ability to turn off Amber Alerts or prevent themselves
from ringing when it receives an Amber Alert. This sparked controversies about how Amber
Alert are delivered. Some argued that the ringtone of the Alert disrupts people’s activities,
such as being distracted or shocked when driving, which could cause lethal accidents. Some
argued that the Amber Alert system is sometimes faulty, and messages are delayed or from
other regions. There is any related research on the public’s opinion of the Amber Alert
system, so this is a difficult problem which has not been solved or researched into.

We would like to investigate what the public think about the Amber Alert system. Also, we
want to identify which Tweets on Twitter are informational and which are opinion-based
regarding Amber Alert. To answer this question, we used Tweepy, a Python library, to extract
relevant Tweets, performed data analysis, and built several machine learning models which
helped us answer these two questions.
